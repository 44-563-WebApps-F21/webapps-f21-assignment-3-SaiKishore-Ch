    <h6>My favorite place is California</h6>
        <p>
            From Hollywood dreams to Silicon Valley start-ups;
            from <b>Napa Valley vineyards to miles of free beaches</b>, California is one of the most beautiful and livable places in America.
            Whether youâ€™re climbing the corporate ladder or El Capitan in Yosemite Valley, The <b>Golden State is the place for you</b>.
            I like a lot, beacause california is such a wonderful city to explore.

      <h1>Code Display - Combinatorics</h1>
      <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics">Combinatorics is an area of mathematics primarily concerned with counting, both as a means and an end in obtaining results, and certain properties of finite structures. It is closely related to many other areas of mathematics and has many applications ranging from logic to statistical physics, from evolutionary biology to computer science, etc.
        The full scope of combinatorics is not universally agreed upon. According to H.J. Ryser, a definition of the subject is difficult because it crosses so many mathematical subdivisions. Insofar as an area can be described by the types of problems it addresses, combinatorics is involved with: For more Information: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics">Click Here</a></blockquote>
