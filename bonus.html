    <h1 style="color:red;">Crimson Dynamo</h1>
    <p>Numerous men have inhabited the various versions of the Crimson Dynamo armor, and some of them have even gone on to switch sides and join forces with Tony Stark.
       But as a concept, the Crimson Dynamo is one of Iron Man's most frequently recurring and difficult foes. 
       Originally conceived as a Soviet counter to Iron Man's armor, the first Crimson Dynamo armor was based around magnetic field technology designed to counteract Stark's repulsor tech.  
       Over the years, the Dynamo armor has evolved to incorporate more varied weapons and is more like a platform for various technologies and armaments, similar to the Iron Man armor itself.
